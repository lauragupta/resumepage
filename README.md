# resumepage

This site is to showcase my work so far. It is a responsive site using a lot of CSS including flexbox and styling for media screens. There are lots of links and screenshots to showcase some of the sites I have done so far. Navigation links jump to the corresponding sections on the page. My most recent refactoring project is highlighted on the page with a larger section and photo for emphasis. I also updated my resume to emphasize my new carreer path. 

## Features
Here are some screenshots of the way the site is responsive...
